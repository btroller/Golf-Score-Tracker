# Golf Score Tracker [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/btroller/Golf-Score-Tracker.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/btroller/Golf-Score-Tracker)

This is a very simple tool I wrote to track scores in games of [Golf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf_(card_game)). 

I wrote this to experiment with Rust, which I haven't used before. Maybe I'll update it to leverage the language better in the future, but I was only shooting for a minimally-viable product.

Apologies for not using snake_case -- I just can't help myself.

## TODO

* Add ability to edit scores
* Make spacing from beginning of line to player names consistent
* Use a table to lay out results of each hole
